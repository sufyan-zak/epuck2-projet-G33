A line follower delivery robot, done in the as part of "Embedded Systems and Robotics" course teached by Prof. Francesco Mondada. 
A mini-project by Sufyan Zakeeruddin and Yassir Belguerch, in 3rd year Bachelor of Microengineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/).
The robot used is the [e-puck2](https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/e-puck2)

# brief
- A line follower delivery robot, using stepper motors and camera
- Can go from a node A to a node B by applying Dijkstra algorithm
- Real-Time  adaptation ; obstacle detection and bypassing using IR Sensors and ToF

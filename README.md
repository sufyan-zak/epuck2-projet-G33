<img src="./e-puck.jpg"/>

A line follower delivery robot, done as part of "Embedded Systems and Robotics" course teached by Prof. Francesco Mondada, and assisted by Dr. Matthieu Broisin and Daniel Burnier.
A mini-project by Sufyan Zakeeruddin and Yassir Belguerch, in 3rd year Bachelor of Microengineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/).
The robot used is the [e-puck2](https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/e-puck2). GCtronics [e-puck2_main_processor](https://github.com/e-puck2/e-puck2_main-processor) library was used.


# Brief
- A line follower delivery robot, using stepper motors and camera
- Goes and comes back from a node A to a node B using the shortest path by applying Dijkstra algorithm
- Real-Time  adaptation : obstacle detection and bypassing using IR Sensors and ToF
